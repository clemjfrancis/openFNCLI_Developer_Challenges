## OpenFN CLI Developer Challenge Answers

This repository contains the answers to the OpenFN CLI developer challenges. Each JavaScript file includes the challenge description as well as the output.

**Note:** Some jobs may require different state configurations. Therefore, there are different `state.json` files for different challenges:

- `tmp/covid/state.json` contains the state for the `getMetadata.js` file.
- `tmp/posts/state.json` contains the state for the files that use `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`.

The answers for Challenge 4 can be found in the `.txt` file.
